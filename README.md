## What is SASS?

SASS is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS by introducing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more. It simplifies the process of writing and maintaining CSS code, making it easier to create and manage complex stylesheets for your web projects.

### Key Features of SASS:
- **Variables:** Define reusable values that can be used throughout your stylesheets.
- **Nesting:** Organize your styles with nested rules, similar to how HTML elements are nested.
- **Mixins:** Create reusable blocks of styles and apply them to multiple elements.
- **Partials:** Break your SASS code into smaller files for better organization.
- **Import:** Easily include SASS files in other SASS files.
- **Functions:** Create custom functions to generate CSS dynamically.
- **Control Directives:** Use control directives like `@if`, `@for`, and `@each` to write more powerful and dynamic styles.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository and use the SASS files, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sass-files-repo.git
    ```

2. **Install SASS Compiler:** Make sure you have the SASS compiler installed on your system. If not, you can install it using Node Package Manager (NPM) by running the following command:

    ```shell
    npm install -g sass
    ```

3. **Compile SASS to CSS:** Use the SASS compiler to convert SASS files into CSS. Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

    ```shell
    sass --watch src/scss:dist/css
    ```

   This command watches for changes in the SASS files and compiles them to the `dist/css` directory.

4. **Start Using SASS:** You can now start using the SASS files in your project by including the compiled CSS in your HTML.
